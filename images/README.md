# My FullStack Journey

Welcome to my first project after completing 2-month block of a FullStack web development course. During this period, I acquired foundational programming languages and skills without any prior knowledge.

## Technologies Used

In this journey, I've leveraged a variety of technologies to create web applications:

- **HTML:** The backbone of web content.
- **CSS:** For styling and layout.
- **SASS:** Used extensively in the "Galery" project for efficient CSS development.
- **Bootstrap:** Employed in the "Map" project and partially on the main page to enhance layout and design.

## About the Projects

### Main Page

The main page serves as a showcase for all the projects I've worked on over the past month. Among these projects, four were meticulously crafted based on provided design layouts, while the remaining two represent my own creative expressions and the result of diligent independent work.

One of the highlights of this page is the demonstration of how Bootstrap can be selectively applied to enhance specific parts of a project, contributing to a polished and cohesive user experience. 

This page encapsulates the journey of learning and practical application of web development skills, marking a significant milestone in my FullStack developer journey.


### Project Coffee

Despite being the simplest of the assigned projects, Project Coffee played a crucial role in my learning journey. With guidance from my mentor, I not only initiated the project but also independently refined it to align perfectly with the provided design layout. Additionally, I worked extensively to ensure its responsiveness.

### Project Galery

Project Galery showcases my proficiency in SASS, a powerful CSS preprocessor. I've used SASS to streamline the styling process and create a visually appealing gallery. It demonstrates my ability to work with advanced CSS techniques..

In addition to that, I took the design to the next level by adding styles to the images and frames that give the impression of real paintings.

### Project Map

In Project Map, I integrated the Bootstrap library to enhance the user interface and provide a smooth user experience. Bootstrap's components and responsive design capabilities were instrumental in creating a functional map application.

### Project HereNow

Project HereNow showcases my versatility in web development. I've added different styles for various breakpoints in the mobile version, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience.

### Additional Projects

On my website, you'll also find two additional projects: "Project Cat" and "Project Nurse," which were entirely designed and developed by me. These projects showcase my proficiency in web development and encompass various features, including user-triggered animations and keyframes-driven automatic animations. 

### Project "Model"
In modern web development, there are many scenarios where you need to create target pages where users can view larger images by hovering over certain elements. In this project, within a simple and stylish design, I provide a convenient and intuitive solution for adding new images while maintaining a cohesive aesthetic.

## What I've Achieved

- Developed web applications from scratch.
- Applied responsive design principles for a seamless user experience.
- Leveraged SASS for efficient and maintainable CSS in Project Galery.
- Utilized Bootstrap to enhance the layout and styling in Project Map and parts of the main page.
- Gained valuable experience in problem-solving and debugging.
- Demonstrated my commitment to continuous learning and self-improvement.

## Conclusion

This project reflects not only the technical skills I've acquired but also the dedication and hard work I've put into my web development journey. It's just the beginning, and I'm excited to take on more challenging projects and continue honing my skills as a FullStack developer.

Thank you for checking out my project!
