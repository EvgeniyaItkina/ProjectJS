# My FullStack Journey

Welcome to my evolving project portfolio following a 5-month intensive block of a FullStack web development course. Starting from scratch, I've acquired foundational skills in programming languages and web development technologies.

## Technologies Used

Throughout this journey, I've utilized a range of technologies to build various web applications, including:

- **HTML**: The essential building block of web content.
- **CSS**: For styling and enhancing layout.
- **SASS**: Extensively used in the "Gallery" project for efficient CSS development.
- **Bootstrap**: Applied in the "Map" project and partially on the main page for responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Encompassing API requests, DOM manipulation, callback functions, and local storage. Also explored the canvas for dynamic web elements.
- **TypeScript**: Leveraged for adding static type definitions to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- **OOP Concepts**: Applied Object-Oriented Programming principles across projects to structure code more efficiently and logically.

## Projects Overview

### Main Page

The main page serves as a showcase for all projects, highlighting my ability to translate design layouts into functional web applications. It demonstrates selective Bootstrap application for enhanced user experience.

### Project Coffee 
A foundational project that emphasized design alignment and responsiveness, under mentorship guidance.

### Project Gallery
Demonstrates SASS proficiency for advanced CSS styling, creating a visually appealing image gallery.

### Project Map
Utilizes Bootstrap for UI/UX enhancement in a functional map application.

### Project HereNow
Focuses on mobile responsiveness with various styles for different breakpoints.

### Additional Projects
- **Project Cat & Project Nurse**: My original creations, featuring user interaction through animations.
- **Project Model**: Offers a solution for viewing larger images with a simple, stylish design.

## Newly Added Projects

- **Project Screen Builder**: A modular design approach with enhanced HTML knowledge. Uses local storage for data management.
- **Project Clock**: Implements API for real-time information on capital cities and flags, with timezone adjustments.
- **Project Simon**: Employs asynchronous technology with a unique outcome display upon game loss.
- **Project Task Manager**: Combines DOM manipulation, local storage, and OOP principles for task management.
- **Project Calculator**: Utilizes callback functions and switch cases for a functional calculator interface.
- **Project Snake**: A complex, self-taught project using the canvas, with consideration for mobile responsiveness.

## Achievements

- Developed and refined web applications from scratch.
- Applied responsive design principles across projects for an optimal user experience.
- Enhanced layout and styling using Bootstrap and SASS.
- Addressed complex web development scenarios using JavaScript, and the canvas.

## Conclusion

This portfolio not only showcases my technical skills but also my dedication to learning and improving as a FullStack developer. I look forward to tackling more challenging projects and continuing my journey in web development.

Thank you for exploring my projects!
